This is a web-based To - Do application developed as a software engineering project for the MERN course.

## :grey_question: Technical Details

The project is written almost entirely in javascript, both the frontend and the backend. A list of dependencies can be found at the end of the [package.json](package.json) file.

The databases use MongoDB as the backend.

## :man_technologist: MERN Stack
MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack.

MongoDB — document database

Express(.js) — Node.js web framework

React(.js) — a client-side JavaScript framework

Node(.js) — the premier JavaScript web server

Express and Node make up the middle (application) tier. Express.js is a server-side web framework, and Node.js is the popular and powerful JavaScript server platform. Regardless of which variant you choose, ME(RVA)N is the ideal approach to working with JavaScript and JSON, all the way through.
